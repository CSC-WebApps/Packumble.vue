# Lessons Learned

1. There can be extra plugins we can add to Vue. For example for dropdowns, we can have `v-select` (https://vue-select.org/) that makes it easier to define a dropdown. But I think it's better to stick to the basic Vue for now.
2. You can easily forget to add the `id` attribute for the app state. 
3. There are different ways to create a Vue application. I tried the simplest one that was the closest to AngularJS, since that's the framework I'm most familiar with. 
4. The lack of something like Angular's $http  was noticable. Maybe there is a similar thing available for Vue, but I didn't find an easy way to use it.
5. Liked how there was options for anything I wanted to do. (e.g. conditional event handler)
